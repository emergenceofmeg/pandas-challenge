# pandas-challenge

I chose the PyCitySchool data to complete my pandas challenge. All work completed in jupyter notebook can be found in the PyCitySchools folder. You will also find my analysis or conclusions there. 

I noticed that I prefer to  create lists and then using those lists to create new data frames. Though I am not sure why, as I get more familiar, I will try creating a dictionary of list and then converting to a dataFrame. 

Giving the data cleaner format did not seem like a priority. My goal was to complete the challenge.
